# Feedback for Group #8

## Overall Feedback for Deliverable #2

As of commit #8e2ca8, the structure of the project is unclear. You have two `App.java` files in different packages. One is empty, the other one has a single print statement. Your dataset file is missing from your repository (`doc.txt`). It does not seem if the project is functional at the commit. Please check with me to see if you can get full credit.
