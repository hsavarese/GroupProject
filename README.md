**Update on MongoDB Setup and Document Handling**

Since Kendra couldn’t attend class and Hunter arrived a bit late, I wanted to share what we learned about using MongoDB for project. I've been able to gather all the information,so I created a MongoDB database to store our documents.

### What We Did

1. **MongoDB Setup:** We learned how to create and manage a MongoDB database. I have already set up our database to facilitate document uploads.
   
2. **Project Structure:** I created a project tree using a UML diagram. You can take a look at the code, which illustrates how to use MongoDB to create and upload documents.

### Current Challenge

One issue we’re facing before actulaly go deeper into the project  is to upload documents to MongoDB , We dpnt have a method to extract the contents of those documents. For our previous homework assignments (Homework 2 and 3), we did methods to extract text from documents, and I’d like to use similar logic for our team project.

### Request for Assistance

I need your help to provide code that will read and extract every word from a document just this and then we will be able to use the DAtaManager method to upload document to MangoDB. While I can utilize my code from past assignments, it’s important to ensure that we collaborate on this as a team project. Please share your ideas or code snippets so we can move forward together.


ps: in the datamanager.java we will call the method that is going to extarxt the document so, I call it extractDocument, so when youll work on it just name the file like that .

Thank you!

Here is a Screenshot of what our tree project look like in the computer(We also discuss about it during class with the instructor) .
